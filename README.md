## Introduction
Welcome to the homepage of the CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) analysis code!

This folder contains 5 code files written in Python 3, 
that produce plots out of data recorded from mice using CGM.

You can reach us at [Ben-Zvi Lab](https://www.benzvilab.com/).

## Requirements 
1. Installation of Python 3 with the following packages:
    ```
   datetime
   matplotlib.pyplot
   numpy
   os.path
   statistics
   sys
   ```
2. CSV file with the columns... recorded as...
   adding an example...

## Setup
1. Download the file that creates the plot you are interested in 
2. Download the supplementary file 
3. Add both files to your working directory
4. Run the file from 1 using Python workbench 

## Files
#### [FILE: supplementary_file](supplementary_file.py)
    write here about the file
#### [FILE: multiple_plots_raw](multiple_plots_raw.py)
#### [FILE: plot_single_mouse_avg](plot_single_mouse_avg.py)
#### [FILE: plot_single_mouse_std](plot_single_mouse_std.py)
#### [FILE: plot_all_mice_avg](plot_all_mice_avg.py)
