## Introduction
Welcome to the homepage of the CGM (continuous glucose monitoring) analysis code!

This folder contains 5 code files written in Python 3, 
that produce plots out of data recorded from mice using CGM.

You can reach us at [Ben-Zvi Lab](https://www.benzvilab.com/).

## Requirements 
1. Installation of Python 3 with the following packages:
    ```
   datetime
   matplotlib.pyplot
   numpy
   os.path
   statistics
   sys
   ```
2. CSV file with the columns... recorded as...
   adding an example...
3. Always use the supplementary file 

## Files
#### [FILE: supplementary_file](supplementary_file.py)
    write here about the file
#### [FILE: multiple_plots_raw](multiple_plots_raw.py)
#### [FILE: plot_single_mouse_avg](plot_single_mouse_avg.py)
#### [FILE: plot_single_mouse_std](plot_single_mouse_std.py)
